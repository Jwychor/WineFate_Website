## Usage

In production, this website is built to receive information from a database to provide a survey for users. When the user submits their survey response, their email and results will be stored in the database and their results will be displayed. This includes a description and picture of a particular wine grape that corresponds with their personality. This project is a demo of a website-design being developed with the owner of Â© Winefate.
