                        Bold, creative and exotic moving right into flamboyant are the words that best describe a Gewurztraminer. 
                        They are distinctive in their looks and manner.  So much so they are almost impossible to disguise. 
                        They are like the movie stars that only play versions of themselves in role after role. 
                        To some they may even seem a bit affected, but they aren’t. 
                        They don’t bother with artifice, although they may try to play their quirkiness down. 
                        But that is difficult for them because they are originals. 
                        Straightforward, they tend to say exactly what they mean, which doesn’t always make them likeable at first meeting.  
                        But they really don’t care what other people think. But when their qualities are realized, people may fight for their company. 
                        They love fashion, but don’t follow trends, and their tastes lean toward the exotic. 
                        If a Gewürztraminer is dull or ordinary it is either because the right opportunities have not come their way, or they attempting to do something that just isn’t in their nature. 
                        They are not good mixers. As a child/young adult they can be quiet, reserved, or even austere, but somewhere along the way to maturity they change into their strong, unique, complex selves. 
                        People do not forget them and they are easily recognized.  They are brainy and are likely to have very high education levels. 
                        They are often misunderstood.
